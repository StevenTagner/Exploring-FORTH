# Exploring-FORTH
My Notes, programs, and links in exploring the programming language FORTH
Note: everything is currently very messy, this repo is a copy/paste dump at the
moment but I am working on making everything look nice so my apologies for poorly
formatted or hard-to-find information!


## General Info
Forth is a stack based programming language. What makes it unique is that programmers and users
call functions and variables via *words*, which define everything in FORTH. Today it is mainly
used by hobbyists but can be used in systems programming, embedded hardware, game development,
and more.

Here are some links that I found helpful and/or interesting while exploring forth:

## Forth Distributions and Compilers

####CiForth
A potential way to compile forth (I have not looked into it very much, just something to be aware of)
https://forth.hcc.nl/producten/ciforth.html
https://github.com/albertvanderhorst/ciforth

####Win32Forth
A Windows implementation of the forth language, docs say it works for Windows95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP so possible problems with Win10/11
http://win32forth.sourceforge.net/doc/p-index.htm

####GForth
A way to compile forth using GCC
https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gforth/
https://arduino-forth.com/article/FORTH_parOuCommencer
https://gforth.org/manual/index.html
http://bernd-paysan.de/gforth.html

####Glade
This tool allows you to design GUIs using XML files

####Visual Forth
This is a way to create GUIs with Forth and installed tools (need to check to see if its safe)
http://www.visualforth.org/

####MPEForth
Paid service for a Forth development system and lots of forth related activities (IDE, code optimizing, library, networking, etc)

####ARMForth
A forth build for 32 bit ARM Machines
